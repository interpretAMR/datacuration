On November 25th, 2024 there were ASTs available for 4010 genomes of Campylobacter, but in AllTheBacteria AFP data was available only for 3522 of them.

From the remaining 488, 484 genomes could be downloaded as assemblies from NCBI and the other 4 (SAMN13718873,SAMN20119351,SAMN22985687,SAMN37751381) as FASTQ short raw reads. The latter were assembled with SKESA 2.5.1.

All 488 assembled genomes were analyzed with AMRFinderPlus 4.0.3 using the following command:

amrfinder --plus --print_node -O Campylobacter -o file_output.txt -n file_input_genomic.fna.gz

Non-empty results were obtained for 358 genomes, that are present in ATB_Campylobacter_AFP_complement1.tsv.gz.
